/**
 *	After writing the GPTIMER driver I began thinking that these are probably
 *	not the best timers to use for the tick timer and time count stuff, rather  
 *	perhaps it's a better idea to use the timers built into the A9 core.
 *
 *	My reasoning is that the GPTIMER driver really should (and currently does)
 *	take a mutex to protect access to the timer structure when reading the time
 *	counter, and this may not be a good idea within system callback functions
 *	like timecounter.  However that said the locks are currently SPIN_MTX
 *	types so I think this *shouldn't* be a problem.
 *
 *	Regardless I think it is probably better to just use the A9 Core global
 *	timer and be done with it.
 *
 *
 *	Current System Timer Design
 *	===========================
 *
 *		Tick Timer  => uses =>  Core 0 Private timer
 *	    Timecount   => uses =>  ARM Global timer
